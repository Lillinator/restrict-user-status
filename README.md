# Discourse restrict user status
This component restricts the ability of Discourse users to set user status to select groups, including forum staff, superusers, etc. If you have already enabled the user status plugin and let users fill their user status, then you will likely need to re-install the plugin or do a rake task on user statuses to reset them all to default blank setting (backup first!).
