# restrict_user_status
This component restricts the Discourse user status setup functionality to select groups, including forum staff, superusers, etc. This component will only work if you have not already enabled the user status plugin and let users fill their user status. Otherwise you may need to re-install the plugin or do a rake task on user statuses.
